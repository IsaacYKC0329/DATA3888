2. If the link is not working, you can open the app.R file in this repository. Click 'Run App' button on the top right side. 
   - Please make sure you have **installed all required packages**! 
   - If the model is not working, please **run these in your R console** before run the app: 
   
   `load("ABMR_RF_model_3000.RData")`
   
   `load("ABMR_Outcome.RData")`
   
   `load("ordered_gene_data.RData")`
   
   `load("TCMR_RF_model_1000.RData")`
   
   `load("TCMR_Outcome.RData")`
   
   `load("ordered_gene_data_tcmr.RData")`

## Functions

### Predictor Page

The 'Predictor' Page can determine the probability of patients experiencing rejection.

##### Predictor

Upload a patient's data and click 'Result' button to predict. Please **wait until it says 'Upload complete'** before clicking the 'Result' button. 

Sample CSV files are in the 'Test csv files' repository. 

##### Child Patient
